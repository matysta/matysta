# Matěj Šťastný – Developer & Game Designer

Hi! I'm Matěj Šťastný – a student developer passionate about creative tools, games, and making interactive experiences that feel personal and expressive. I'm currently based near Seattle, WA, and preparing to pursue Computer Science at the university level.

I love working on projects that combine technical challenge with artistic vision – from multiplayer games to utilities that make people's lives just a bit easier. Whether it’s writing custom game engines, experimenting with generative design, or contributing to open source, I’m always looking for ways to learn and create.
